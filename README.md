# FrameApplication
Most of the time we create windows application from scratch and implement all structures that are very basic.  This 'FrameApplication' gives you a standard and matured framework that is flexible enough to fit to any requirement. This is a complete opensource project allows everyone to use it for both commercial and non-commercial purpose.  Any addition and improvement is welcome :)

# MVVM with Caliburn.Micro
Caliburn rely on 'Naming convention'.

Till this(https://github.com/IdeaLaboratory/FrameApplication/commit/b1add891d758ede53fa26a2474f4e78830b595ed) we have 'Views' and 'ViewModels' folders. In the folders we have Main"View" and Main"ViewModel" classes respectively.
Bootstrapper knows what is the view model to start with and by naming convention it figure out the view class at the startup.
